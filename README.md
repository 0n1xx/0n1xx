# Hi, I'm Vlad Sakharov 👋

I'm a **Data Analyst / Full-stack Developer ** with over two years of professional experience at **Ozon Fintech** and **Karpov Courses**, where I designed production data pipelines, conducted in-depth analyses, and delivered actionable insights to stakeholders.

I've been passionate about data since I was 17 — turning raw information into clear answers through queries, automation, or visualization has always excited me.

Currently studying **Computer Programming** at **Georgian College** (Ontario, Canada) to strengthen my full-stack development skills. Combining a strong analytical background with hands-on programming allows me to build complete, end-to-end solutions — from data ingestion to interactive web applications.
