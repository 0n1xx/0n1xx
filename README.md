Hey everyone! My name is Vlad. I worked as an analyst at Ozon Fintech for two-plus years and held DA/DE-related positions at Karpov Courses.  
Since I was 19, I have been passionate about working with data. I have always found it exciting to answer my questions, whether by doing research or writing a query. I am currently studying "Computer Programming" at Georgian College :)
